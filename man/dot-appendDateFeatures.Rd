\description{
Appends date features to data frame. Creates new column 'date' based on var
if date is not already in the data frame. The newly created (or existing)
date column is truncated to day. Columns for year, day of year (doy), decimal
year (dyear), and month are added based on date. This function relies on
smwrBase::baseDay and smwrBase::baseDay2decimal for doy and decimal year.
  
The baseDay and baseDay2decimal functions have been added to this package 
from smwrBase package.
